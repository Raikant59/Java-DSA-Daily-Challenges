There are four pillars of OOPs.
1.Encapsulation
2.Inheritance
3.Polymorphism
4.Abstraction

Encapsulation :- Wrapping up of data and methods under a single unit. It also implements data hiding.
      Constructor :- It is a special method that invoked automatically at the time of the object creation.
                   Types of Constructor:- 
                     1. Non-Paramaterized
                     2. Parameterized
                     3. Copy Constructor
      Destructor :- In c++, there are special function that delete object memory which is del function. while In Java, Garbage collector is present 
                    that automatically delete the variables, objects after theybecome unused.

Inheritance :- It is when properties and methods of parent class are passed to child class.
      They are of 5 types:-
      1. Single Inheritance
      2. Multiple Inheritance - This was not present in java. To do this we use interfaces in java.
      3. Multilevel Inheritance
      4. Hierarchical Inheritance
      5. Hybrid Inheritance

Polymorphism :- It means exist in Multiple forms.
      Types of Polymorphism:-
      1.Compile Time Polymorphism
           Method Overloading 
      2.Runtime Polymorphism
           Method Overriding

Abstraction :- It is a concept of hiding the internal details and showing only the necessary information to the user.
       It is implements using :- 
       1. Abstract Class
       2. interfaces

There are two keywords also :- 
       1. Super
       2. Static
